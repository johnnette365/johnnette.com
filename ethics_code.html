                        contains the basic standards adopted by the Company's Board of Directors (the Board) that relate
                        to the honest, ethical and legal standards of conduct of directors,
                        officers, employees and Business Partners of Johnnette Technologies Pvt Ltd.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It is the Company's policy that its directors, officers, employees, and Business Partners are
                        held to the highest standards of honest and ethical conduct when conducting the affairs of the
                        Company. In further, it is the personal responsibility of each
                        director, officer, employee and Business Partners of the Company to adhere to the standards and
                        restrictions, whether imposed by law or by this Code, applicable to his or her assigned duties
                        and responsibilities and to conduct
                        himself or herself accordingly. Such standards and restrictions require each director, officer,
                        and employee to avoid any activities which would involve the Company in any practice which is
                        not in compliance with applicable laws
                        or this Code. Any director, officer, employee or Business Partners who does not adhere to such
                        standards and restrictions is acting outside the scope of his or her employment or agency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In particular, this Code summarizes Company's policies and guidelines that ensure and/or
                        promote:
                    </p>

                            apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships.</li>
                        <li>Compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.</li>

                        <li>Accountability for adherence to this Code.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We believe that conducting Company's business honestly, ethically and with integrity are crucial
                        to Company's continued success and growth and are essential attributes of the Company's
                        reputation. We strongly believe that a reputation

                            vary from place to place, honesty and integrity are not subject to criticism in any culture.
                        </li>

                            policies and procedures and to seek advice from the Company's legal consultants if they have
                            any questions about whether a legal requirement applies to a particular situation or what
                            conduct may be required to comply with any

                            community, shareholders, customers, suppliers

                            directors, officers, employees and/or Business Partners to avoid violations of the
                            requirements of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of
                            Foreign Officials in International Business Transactions (the "Convention"), and
                            accordingly, the legislation amendment to the Indian companies act 1956 & 2013 establishing
                            a criminal offense of bribing a foreign public official
                            (the "Act"). We also endorse the Global Principles of Business Ethics for the Aerospace and
                            Defense Industry and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), India. Each

                        <li style="padding-top: 0;"><strong> Full compliance of this Code by Business Partners of the
                                Company :</strong> It is the clear policy of the Company that its agents, distributors,
                            representatives, consultants, or any kind of sales promotion and introduction
                            service providers and business partners ("Business partners") shall be bound by this Code.
                            Accordingly, any Business Partner is required to comply with this Code and acknowledges and
                            undertakes to be bound by its terms as part
                            of such Business Partner’s engagement with the Company.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong> Procedures for engagement with Business partners :</strong> Anti-bribery laws
                            prohibit "indirect" actions as well as direct bribery actions. For example, payment or any
                            attempt to make a payment, directly or indirectly,
                            in order to influence others is prohibited, including in pursue of an award of a contract or
                            an order, or any favorable treatment in connection with a business transaction shall be
                            deemed as a bribe. Therefore, there is a possibility
                            that the Company may be involved in a bribery action, even when the actual act was performed
                            by a third party. Accordingly, in order to prevent the possibility that the Company will be
                            involved in a bribery action as a result
                            of acts by third parties, the Company has implemented preventive measures consisting of the
                            procedures set forth below.

                            is intended to identify potential alerts for such Business Partners.
